Demos for Basic Arenas.


Pkg Version: >= 0.4a8
Usage: Copy the Python source files from a demo and paste them into the "src" folder.
Example: If you want to use the beta-spawn-swamp-basic (green arena), copy the "main.py" and "bg.py" files from the green demo and paste them into the "src" folder in your project.
Additionally, it provides a compiled "main.mjs" file that you can copy and paste to overwrite the actual "main.mjs" file executed by the game.
